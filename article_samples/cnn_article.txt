Story highlights Sen. Rand Paul sustained six rib fractures in an attack The fight had nothing to do with politics, Boucher's attorney has said Washington (CNN) The man who allegedly assaulted GOP Sen. Rand Paul outside his Kentucky residence pleaded not guilty Thursday to misdemeanor assault in the fourth degree at his arraignment in Bowling Green. Rene Boucher allegedly tackled Paul, breaking six of his ribs and sustaining bruised lungs. There was no change to the charges and no change in bond. Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, told CNN Thursday that Boucher attacked the senator without any prior conversation. "Last week, Sen. Paul was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood. This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities," Stafford told CNN in a statement. "As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years." He continued: "The first 'conversation' with the attacker came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken. This was not a 'fight,' it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention."
